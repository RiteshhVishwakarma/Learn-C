# Problem Solving
For Problem Solving we Create Flowcharts/Blueprints and algorithm.

# Algorithm
An algorithm is a clear, step-by-step set of instructions designed to solve a problem or complete a task. It breaks down the process into simple actions, which are followed in sequence to achieve the desired outcome efficiently and accurately.

## Examples of Algorithms in C
1. Start
2. input
3. c = a + b
4. print or display c
5. Stop

# Flowcharts
A flowchart is a diagram that shows the steps process or system using symbols and arrows. Each symbol represents a different step or decision, making it easy to understand and follow the sequence of actions needed to complete a task.
